Не палец
========

Reduce any language question to a choice of three options:
* A
* B
* Both A and B

Where the answer can be Both, the meaning is likely to be slightly different, so it will be good to show an image or an animation to indicate the differences.

We can use any key under the right hand home positions, LHHP, and the space bar.

The options can be about:
* Is this grammatically correct?
* Is this the most appropriate choice in the circumstances?

The purpose of Не палец is to get the player to discover the underlying pattern, implicitly. The player may invent a rule, or may just react intuitively.

The importance is volume: enough diverse examples
